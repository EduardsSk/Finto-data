# Can be used e.g. with the DCMI Type vocabulary:
# wget http://dublincore.org/2010/10/11/dctype.rdf -q -O - | ./skosify.py -c owl2skos.cfg -o dctype-skos.ttl

# runtime options which correspond to command line parameters

# define custom RDF namespaces that can then be used in the mappings below (and will also be used in the output file)
# Note that common namespaces are already defined: rdf, rdfs, owl, skos, dc, dct

# define what to do with types in the source vocabulary, i.e. how these map to SKOS constructs
# key: CURIE or localname (string)
# value: CURIE or empty (to delete the instances)
# the <key> instances will be replaced with <value> instances.
# key may start with * which matches any localname prefix
# Note: use period '.' instead of colon ':' as separator in key CURIEs

# define what to do with literal properties on Concepts
# key: CURIE or localname (string)
