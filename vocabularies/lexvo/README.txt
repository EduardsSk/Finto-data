Skosify is used to fix some problems with the original data, namely:
- use of <lvont:GeographicalConcept> and similar as if they were proper URIs
- use of the once-suggested-but-then-retracted SKOS 2008 namespace

In addition, lvont:Language instances are typed as skos:Concept and their
labels represented using skos:prefLabel and skos:altLabel.
